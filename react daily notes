why react is chosen as frontend (key feturres)
 delcarative / imperative
 =>imperative -- step by step approach --- js does
1) =>declarative -- already coded  and only the cmd is passed i.e the steps run  at background -- react does predefined functions 
2) performance wise react best as it uses virutal dom whereas angular uses shallowd om,realdom
3)oneway data binding a->b no b->a angular is 2 way data binding a->b  b->a happens
4)no separate file needed like agular html,css,ts
5)error handling 
6)beginner friendly whereas angular intermediate friendly
7)a) key features: reusable components elments can be reused (through import ,export modules)
b) we can use css,js,html at same pg through jsx file

components - file is an componenets
type of componenets
- function based componoents if a function returns elements, strings, function then it's function based componenets
-classs based componenets if a class returns elements class based componenets



11-09-24 react
 export defulat accepts for normal function but not for arrow function
 class based componenets
 need to render
 need to extends from the react components
 and return 
 function based component returns ellemnts whereas 
 func ion returns only value

  state - data management, data handling
  js code execution 
  
  
  13-09-24
  state 
  -state is temporary storage for the particular component
  -it can be  achieved by props when it should used in another component
  -rerendering occcurs only in the particular compnent where state is used
  -boolean ,strings , numbers are compared by value but object , array are compared by refernce 


-use keyword used means that comes under hooks concept
-class based compponent is a stateful componenets as it has inbuilt state methods we can call by .state method and by using extends react component
-function based compnent is a stateless components as it only imports the state componenets


-hooks are functions or methods

 from api fetch any two data and and show in web browser using usestate , map 


16-09-24
what is state?
state is one of the hooks can be achived in function through usestate
hooks should be called at top it shoukd not be called innbtw
 virtual dom 
 normal actual dom --> has old one --> old virtual dom --> without changes 
							--> new virtual dom  --> with changes
							--> comparision of old and virtual dom occurs 
							--> updates in new actual dom 
							--> it focus on the componnet present 
							
							
							
17-09-24
props
one way data binding parent -->child

18-09-24
state
- temporay storage
-value ,function returns 
- hooks used - usestate 
-usestate is a function

task -- react 
counter -- increment , decrement using props state

life cycle of components
 what's components -- it's an elements
initiailzation
-- setup props and states 
the state which we write when we shift to one component to 
another the state , props  gets initalize by itself
 initalily there were methods to initalize the state and props now as it was not in use all those methods was deprecated
mounting 
--When an element is added  that phase is said to bge mounting phase

-- methods
1)componentWillmount - when the elements 
created, before elemnts are created this function gets trigeered 
 when we use many components to create and created when u need to do a particular task before this component is created during those 
 times this function willmount can be used given by react

--we don't need to go and trigeer this function as it get sstrigeerred by itself whenever we create a component before i.e during a navigation from one component to other generally the old components 
gets deleted and new gets inserted so beofre insertion it happens


2)render - this is after this will mount function , in ui it been displayted the elements so that time render happens 
 before render willmount after render didmount

3)componnetDidmount -


updation 
-- same like mounting phase 
the differnce is whenever the update or change is happened during those times this functyion gets trigeered
whereas i mounting phase only one time is trigeered


states
1)shouldcomponentUpdate - this is used as hook in functioned based componnet --usedmemo
this is not much important used for performance...buildup 
2)componentwillupdate - samelike willmount
3)render
4)componentdidupdate - same like didmount

unmounting 
--When an element is  deleted  that phase is said to bge unmounting phase
1)componentwillunmount -sameelike willmount
							
							
							
								
						
common used methods 
- didupdate => state or props changes or updates happen 
-didmount  =>AUTOMATICALLY TRIGEERS   used for data fetching 
-willunmount

-didcatch --error handling
